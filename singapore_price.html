                    <h3>Guidence About singapore</h3>
                    <p>Since the launch of the Uniquely Singapore destination brand in 2004, Singapore witnessed a 16.8% growth in visitor arrivals and a 55.1% growth in its tourism receipts.[citation needed] In order to keep tourism in Singapore competitive and relevant to its visitors, STB hopes to establish its digital presence given the high internet penetration in its key markets, hence embarking on the 2010 YourSingapore campaign to drive users to its online website and social media accounts. <br>

                    YourSingapore was positioned as Singapore's ability to promise travelers a personal travel experience, given the degree of efficiency, control and comfort in the country. Such a promise further offers an emotional reward of empowerment and liberation to its visitors. <br>
                        
                    With a different approach from previous STB brand slogan YourSingapore and EDB's Future Ready Singapore, Passion Made Possible was derived in 2017 in the hope of showcasing the country's entrepreneurial and innovative strengths to the world, under a joint branding campaign between its tourism and business government agencies to market the country to tourists, consumers, investors and businesses.</p>
