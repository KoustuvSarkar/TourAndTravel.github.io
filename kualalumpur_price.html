                    <h3>Guidence About Kulalumpur</h3>
                    <p>Kuala Lumpur is home to me and to 1.8 million other KLites. It is a place where a variety of cultures are all infused into one melting pot to offer a unique experience to visitors. Where else can you savour the meanest street food with one of the world's most iconic structures in the background?   KL is definitely a place where everyday fun and world-class sophistication meet to create a unique destination for travellers, filled with Malaysian charm and friendliness – with greetings of "Selamat Datang" (Welcome) everywhere you go. <br>
                    Kuala Lumpur, the main gateway to Malaysia has a variety of attractions ranging from culture, heritage & places of interest, shopping, entertainment, nature & adventure, luxury travel, sports, business & events, medical & wellness, and education all showcases the city’s contrasts and diversity. This is what makes KL distinctive and the city’s identity was built on its history, people and tradition in the arts and culture. <br>
                    This, I believe is why KL has been ranked as a Top 10 City Destination in the World by Euromonitor International for more than 5 years now. The contrasting history and heritage, from the early days of the small tin mining trading town to the metropolis city it is today yet retaining her fundamental identity, will excite, surprise and entice you to discover more. </p>
