                    <p>Although Malé is geographically located in Kaafu Atoll, administratively it is not considered part of it. The central part of the city is formed by the island of Malé. Five more islands form part of the city which includes Hulhulé, Hulhumalé, Vilimalé, Gulhifalhu and Thilafushi. A commercial harbour is located on the central island and serves as the heart of all commercial activities in the country. Velana International Airport is Located in the Island of Hulhulé.[9] <br>

                    The central island is heavily urbanised, with the built-up area taking up essentially its entire landmass.[9] Slightly less than one third of the nation's population lives in the capital city, and the population has increased from 20,000 people in 1987 to 100,000 people in 2006. Many Maldivians and foreign workers living in other parts of the country find themselves in occasional short term residence on the island since it is the centre of administration and bureaucracy.</p>

                    <p> Vaadhoo Island is a beautiful island in the Maldives which offers beautiful beaches, iconic landscapes and mesmerising beauty. When the sun goes down at Vaadhoo Island, the sea waves lapping the shore light up like a shimmering field of blue dots giving the sea the appearance of the starlit night sky.
                        <br>
                    This incredible phenomenon occurs during the late summer months due to the growth of phytoplankton, or aquatic creatures that glow in the dark. You can stir up the water, and if the plankton is present, it will splash around the gorgeous blue light, creating a mesmerizing sight. However, your chances of seeing this increase when you cruise offshore. The waves break against the boat and make the tiny organisms radiate light.</p>
