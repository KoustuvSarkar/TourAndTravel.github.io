                    <p>Krabi is the main town in the province of Krabi (thesaban mueang) on the west coast of southern Thailand at the mouth of the Krabi River where it empties in Phang Nga Bay. As of 2020, the town had a population of 32,644. The town is the capital of Krabi Province and the 10 Krabi city sub-districts. Tourism is an important industry. Krabi is 783 km (487 mi) south of Bangkok by road. <br>
                    At the start of the Rattanakosin period in the late eighteenth century, when the capital was finally settled at Bangkok, an elephant kraal was established in Krabi by order of Chao Phraya Nakhon (Noi), the governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat, which was by then a part of the Thai Kingdom.[citation needed] He sent his vizier, the Phra Palad, to oversee this task, which was to ensure a regular supply of elephants for the larger town. So many followers immigrated in the steps of the Phra Palad that soon Krabi had a large community in three different boroughs: Pakasai, Khlong Pon, and Pak Lao. In 1872, King Chulalongkorn elevated these to town status, called Krabi, a word that preserves in its meaning the monkey symbolism of the old standard. The town's first governor was Luang Thep Sena, though it continued for a while as a dependency of Nakhon Si Thammarat. This was changed in 1875, when Krabi was raised to a fourth-level town in the old system of Thai government. Administrators then reported directly to the central government in Bangkok, and Krabi's history as an entity separate from other provinces had begun.</p>

                    <p>Karon Viewpoint or Kata Viewpoint. Karon Viewpoint (which used to be Kata viewpoint) is one of the most frequented viewpoints in Phuket. From here, it is possible to take in views of Kata Noi, Kata Yai and Karon beaches. Located between Nai Harn and Kata Noi beaches, the viewpoint is busy most days of the year and is a staple of many tour itineraries. <br>
                    Called locally ‘Khao Saam Haad’ (Three Beaches Hill), the local municipality for some reason has officially renamed it ‘Karon Viewpoint’. It’s located just to the south of Kata Noi Beach and looks out directly out to the Andaman Sea but most people have their cameras trained due north at the undeniably impressive eight-kilometre vista of the three west coast beaches with Mom Tri’s Villa Royale in the foreground and the distant Hilton Arcadia on Karon Beach in the background. <br>

                <div class="spot_info">
                    <p>The most important of the 29 buddhist temples of Phuket is Wat Chalong (Thai: วัดฉลอง) or formally Wat Chaiyathararam (Thai: วัดไชยธาราราม), located in the Chalong Subdistrict, Mueang Phuket District. It is dedicated to two highly venerable monks, Luang Pho Chaem (หลวงพ่อแช่ม) and Luang Pho Chuang (หลวงพ่อช่วง), who led the citizens of Chalong Subdistrict fighting against the Chinese rebellion in 1876 and with their knowledge of herbal medicine helped the injured. <br>
                    Visitors highly recommend a visit to Wat Chalong, as well as a stroll through its impressive, clean and well-maintained grounds, saying that the temple complex exuded peace and serenity. Reviewers also suggest planning a midweek visit, as the temple can get very crowded on the weekends. You'll find Wat Chalong, which is free to visit and open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., a little more than 5 miles southwest of Phuket Town. Before entering, visitors should be aware of the temple's strict dress code: If entering the temple, you're expected to take off your shoes. Women are expected to wear clothing that covers their shoulders and their knees; all visitors are encouraged to speak in hushed tones and refrain from touching the statuary and relics.</p>

                    <p>Wat Phra Thong is a relatively small temple, but with its several buildings and colourful features, it’s a pleasant place to visit. The main attraction is the half-buried golden Buddha image, which is said to be 'untouchable' – every person who has tried to dig it out received a curse in the end. <br>
                    Legend has it that a farmer boy, who tied his buffalo to an object that looked like a post in an open field, fell very ill and died not long afterwards, along with his buffalo. The poor father dreamed about this incident and went to check the post, which turned out to be the top part of a big buried Buddha image. <br>
                    Many villagers came to help with digging it up but only managed to expose half of the statue; they simply couldn’t dig it up no matter how many times they tried. The idea to build a temple around this half-buried Buddha came when a monk on a pilgrimage spotted the holy image. Wat Phra Thong has become the spiritual centre of local communities ever since. <br>
                    A more rational explanation as to why there is a half-buried Buddha image at Wat Prathong is that a nearby canal changed direction and flooded the area, leaving it under a layer of silt. The temple also houses an interesting museum, where you can see historical items donated by locals. Must-sees include tin-mining paraphernalia, a Chinese dowry basket, Chinese teen-tuk (foot-binding) shoes, food carriers, cannons and Javanese daggers.</p>
