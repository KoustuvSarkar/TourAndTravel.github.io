            <div class="about_Hongkong">
                <p>Hong Kong, officially Special Administrative Region of China, is a city on the eastern Pearl River Delta in South China. With over 7.5 million residents of various nationalities, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world. Hong Kong is also one of the most developed cities in the world, with the most expensive housing.</p>

                <div class="spot_info">
                    <p>Hong Kong has one of the most impressive and recognizable skylines in the world. The dense collection of skyscrapers, both on the island of Hong Kong and in Kowloon, combined with the surrounding mountains and harbor set this city apart. <br>
                    In the harbor, traditional red-sailed Chinese junk boats and the historic Star Ferry contrast sharply with the backdrop of modern high-rises. At night, the skyline changes character completely as the sky darkens and the city lights fill the scene. <br>
                    Two of the best places in Hong Kong to see the skyline are from the top of Victoria Peak or from the Kowloon waterfront (along the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade near the clock tower), not far from the Star Ferry dock, where benches line the waterfront and look across to Hong Kong. The latter location is the best place to watch the nightly A Symphony of Lights laser and light show set to music.

            <div class="spot_container">
                <div class="spot_info">
                    <p> The 34-meter-high "Big Buddha" sits above Lantau Island's Po Lin monastery, which was a fairly secluded place until the statue was built in 1993. This is one of the largest Buddha statues of its kind in the world and took 12 years to complete. The size is astounding, both up close and seen from a distance. The setting here is also incredible, surrounded by the green forest and views out over the ocean and islands. <br>
                    Although you can take a bus, the best way to reach the Buddha is via the scenic Ngong Ping cable car, which takes you on a 5.7-kilometer, 25-minute ride over forest, water, and mountains. The ride terminates at the small tourist-focused Ngong Ping Village, which you'll have to walk through before reaching the monastery and Big Buddha. Once through the village, a huge set of stairs leads up to the base, but don't be daunted. The walk up goes quickly, and the views from the base of the statue are well worth the effort.
                    You can access the cable car from the MTR Tung Chung Station. Some people combine a trip to the Big Buddha with a stop at Tai O fishing village, 20 minutes away by bus, but still on Lantau Island. You can also pick up a Hong Kong Travel Pass Combo: MTR Pass, Ngong Ping Cable Car, and Big Buddha Tour, which will give you a one- to three-day MTR Pass (metro), round-trip cable car ride, and a guided tour of the Big Buddha. This is a good deal if you are planning on getting around by MTR during your stay in Hong Kong.</p>

                    <p>You haven't seen the best of Hong Kong until you've taken in the skyline from Victoria Peak, more commonly known as The Peak. Ride the tram to the top of this scenic viewpoint to see the skyscrapers, bustling city, harbor, and surrounding islands. <br>
                    The tram station is located near the entrance to Hong Kong Park by the Murray building. At the top of the tram are the Peak Tower and Peak Galleria, with shops, restaurants, and an observation deck. Most of The Peak is covered by a large park with lush greenery, nature trails, and more beautiful lookouts with views over the thriving metropolis below. <br>
                    A trail also leads down from The Peak to the city below, following a mix of trails through the forest and sections of road here and there. It can be a bit confusing finding your way. See our article on Hong Kong hiking trails for more details. Evening is a great time to visit The Peak, when you can see the spectacular skyline lit against the night sky. This is one of the best views in Hong Kong at night. If the tram line is long, or you want to go directly from your hotel, you can also take a taxi to the top.</p>

                    <p>Not everyone thinks of beaches when they think of Hong Kong, but you don't have to go far to find some incredible stretches of soft-sand. The beach at Repulse Bay is the most popular in all of Hong Kong, with beautiful views and a great place for swimming, although it's very non touristy. A day spent here is complemented with the luxury and style typical of Hong Kong itself. The street running along the oceanfront and overlooking the wide beach is lined with trendy restaurants and shops. Amalfitana is fun place to enjoy a pizza, with casual open-air dining looking over the beach.
                    Another nearby spot for a day at the beach is Big Wave Bay. Here, the water rolls in relatively gently to a large U-shaped cove with a splendid beach. This is a much more relaxed and casual atmosphere than at Repulse Bay. A popular outing is to walk part of the famous Dragon's Back hike to Big Wave Bay and dip in the ocean for a swim. <br>
                    At the back of the beach, barbecues line the walkway to the parking lot and serve up seafood and other tasty treats. Scheduled buses and the occasional taxi are available in the carpark area and will whisk you back to the city. Also worth checking out is scenic Shek O Beach. It's easily accessible via public transit. For more details see our article on the best beaches in Hong Kong.</p>

                    <p> If you've had enough of the tight confines of Hong Kong and are ready for a little exercise, try escaping to the Dragon's Back Hike. Hong Kong's most popular hiking trail, this hike offers spectacular views out over the ocean, Big Wave Bay, Mount Collinson, Stanley, and Shek O. It's a pleasant change from the buzz of the big city to hear birds singing, the sound of small waterfalls, and the leaves rattling in the ocean breeze. <br>
                    The hike is relatively easy but be sure to start at Section 8 (bus stop To Tei Wan). From here, the walk takes you up a short distance and then is predominantly downhill with rolling sections to Big Wave Bay. Once you've reached Big Wave Bay, you have the option of catching a taxi or mini bus to nearby Shek O. <br>
                    Both areas have fantastic beaches for swimming, and Shek O has a variety of restaurants serving good seafood. Don't forget to bring plenty of water and your bathing suit and towel on this hike. A swim to cool down followed by a fruit smoothie or ice-cream at the end of the hike is heavenly.</p>
